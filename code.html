                                    The Integrated Circuit Design Club – “DECCTEROUS” in collaboration with NIE AICTE Idealab, hosted the Innovation and Design Thinking Project Evaluation and Exhibition for the second-semester ECE students on 6th July 2024. External evaluators for this event included Mr. Prabhanjana S K from Siemens (NIE 2023 pass out), Mr. Charan M S from Texas Instruments (NIE 2023 pass out), Mr. Pundlik Anand Nayak from Texas Instruments (NIE 2024 pass out) and Ms. Sangeetha Shayana from Schneider Electric (2024 pass out). This initiative formed an integral part of experiential learning in Innovation and Design thinking, aligned with the second-semester Innovation and Design Thinking Course (BIDTK258).



                                    The internal evaluators for the event were Prof. Narasimha Kaulgud, Dr. Gurumurthy, and Dr. Remya Jayachandran. Students were encouraged to engage in technical documentation and project demonstration, providing them with valuable skills for their future semesters. The event coordinators were Dr. Salila Hedge, Associate Professor, ECED, and Dr. Remya Jayachandran, Assistant Professor, ECED.



                                    Over the past semester, our students have immersed themselves in understanding societal issues, defining the problem statement, and principles of design thinking, and exploring innovative solutions to real-world challenges. Through a dynamic process of empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing, they have developed projects demonstrating their creativity, problem-solving skills, and commitment to making a positive impact.
